## Theory
### decrease

Today, I found important concept "decrease".
Consider two cases:

1. $f(m) \leq \frac{1}{m}$
2. $f(m) \leq \frac{1}{m^2}$

then, 2 decreases faster than 1 with $m$.
If we would like to minimize $f$, 2 is more preferable than 1.

When we evaluate some functions, inequalities are quite useful.
If we would like to minimize the functions, deriving the upper bounds gives useful information.
